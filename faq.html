<h3>How much will registration cost?</h3>
<p>TBA!</p> 
                                    
 
<h3>How will hotel reservations work? Do we need to book our hotel rooms now?</h3>
<p>Mega-Tau Committee has reserved a room block at the Royal Sonesta Hotel! The link to reserve rooms will come out by the end of February. Check your alumni email address for more details.</p>
 
<!-- <h3>When do people usually arrive for Mega-Tau?  When should I plan to leave?</h3>
<p>Check-in is Friday evening and checkout is Sunday morning.</p> -->
 
<h3>Why am I not getting the emails?</h3>
<p>First, please check your spam folder, and be sure to whitelist emails from megatau@mit.edu. Otherwise, we use an emailing service through the MIT Alumni Association, specifically MIT10 for Tau Reunion. Log on to MIT10 with your Infinite Connection account, and under "My Account" confirm: (1) what email our messages are going to, (2) you are subscribed to the Events/Announcements list under "Email Preferences", and (3) what your preferred class year is.</p>

<h3>I want these emails to go to another email!</h3>
<p>Alums can update their own preferred email addresses by logging into their IC account and updating their preferences at alum.mit.edu, by going to log in > My Account > Subscriptions/Edit Profile/Email & Forwarding</p>

<h3>I accidentally unsubscribed from alumni emails! How do I resubscribe?!</h3>
<p>Please contact Alumni Records at <a href="malto:mitalum@mit.edu">mitalum@mit.edu</a> or by calling 617-253-8270 and make the request during business hours Monday - Friday.</p>

<h3>I took some time off and graduated after 201x -- how do I get added to this list to hang with the rest of my classmates?</h3>
<p>You can update your preferred class year with the Alumni Association to be affiliated with the Class of 201X. To join a different class community, please contact Alumni Records at mitalum@mit.edu or by calling 617-253-8270 and make the request.</p>
<p>To make changes to your preferred email and alumni email forwarding, visit alum.mit.edu. To change your preferred class year, please contact Alumni Records at mitalum@mit.edu or by calling 617-253-8270.</p>
  
<h3>What if I have a question that isn't listed here?</h3>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:megatau@mit.edu">megatau@mit.edu</a>

<!-- <h3>Do I need to log in to register for Mega-Tau?</h3>
 <p>An Infinite Connection (IC) account login is required to register for Mega-Tau Reunion. Unable to log in? <a href="https://alum.mit.edu/account/create">Create your account</a> or <a href="https://alum.mit.edu/account/password/reset">retrieve your username or password.</a></p> -->
 
<!-- 
<h3>For events with a limited number of tickets, are tickets lotteried out or given on a first come, first served basis?</h3>
<p>While there will be many events without capacity limits, some events do have capacity limits and <strong>will likely sell out.</strong> Tickets will be sold first-come, first-served, <strong>so act fast if you want to guarantee your spot at an event.</strong> Kickoff and Toast events will be <strong>limited to a +1</strong> during initial registration in order to prioritize alumni access, but will open up closer to the event dates as capacity allows.</p>
                        -->
<!-- <h3>Are there refunds on registration?</h3>
<p>TBA!</p>

            
<h3>Are there refunds on event tickets?</h3>
<p>TBA!</p>

<h3>Can I attend Tau Reunion without officially registering?</h3>
<p>The cost of registration goes towards offsetting the costs for the many free events offered throughout the weekend. Registration is required to attend all official Pi Reunion events, and all attendees, including non-MIT attendees, are required to officially register.</p>

<h3>Do I have to register for the free events?</h3>
<p>Registering helps the Tau Committee estimate the attendance of each event.  Please do register for each free event you plan to attend.</p>
   
<h3>I’m an alum of the Class of 2017/2018/2019, I’m currently abroad, and I will need to apply for a tourist visa to attend the MIT Mega-Tau Reunion. How should I go about obtaining a visa?</h3>
<p>For alums who no longer hold valid F-1 or J-1 student visa status (not on an authorized period of F-1 OPT/STEM OPT Extension or J-1 Academic Training), and do not hold another valid US visa status, and are currently abroad and want to travel to the US, you will need to apply for and obtain a tourist visa. [NOTE: Citizens from certain countries may be able to travel to the US in tourist status, under the <a href = "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html">Visa Waiver Program</a>, without being required to apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate. <a href = "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html"> See a listing of the eligible countries.</a>]</p>
<p>
Individuals who need to apply for a tourist (B-1/B-2) entry visa at the US Embassy/Consulate, should consult the <a href = "https://www.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy/Consulate website</a> in their country of residence to confirm procedures to schedule a visa interview and complete the visa application.</p>
<p>The US Embassy/Consulate website will outline the documents required for the application and interview, and will include documentation such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Originals/copies of your student visa documentation from when you attended MIT (e.g., Form I-20 or Form DS-2019)</li>
<li>Confirmation of the date of the special celebration (e.g., your copy of the Mega-Tau Reunion ; support letter from the MIT Alumni Association*)</li>
<li>Proof of your enrollment/completion of degree at MIT (e.g., copy of <a href = "https://registrar.mit.edu/transcripts-records/digital-diplomas">digital diploma</a>, <a href = "https://registrar.mit.edu/transcripts-records/transcripts-certifications-letters/enrollment-certifications">enrollment verification letter</a>, or <a href = "https://registrar.mit.edu/transcripts-records/transcripts-certifications-letters">copy of transcript)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you will need to apply for a visa at a US Embassy/Consulate, please apply as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are many factors that may impact the ability for a tourist visa to be granted, including pandemic conditions that impact consulate processing. MIT is not able to guarantee that a visa will be issued for travel to the US and is not able to contact the US Embassy/Consulate to request an expedite of visa processing.</p>
<p>*Please contact us at megatau@mit.edu with your details so we can draft this letter of support on your behalf.</p> -->
